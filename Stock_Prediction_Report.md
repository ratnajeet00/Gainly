## 3. Feature Engineering and Technical Analysis

### 3.1 Technical Indicators Implementation

**Moving Averages:**
```python
data['MA_5'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()    # Short-term trend
data['MA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()  # Medium-term trend
```

**Purpose and Significance:**
- **MA_5**: Captures short-term price momentum and immediate trend changes
- **MA_20**: Represents medium-term trend direction and support/resistance levels
- **Crossover Signals**: When MA_5 crosses MA_20, indicates potential trend reversals

**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
```python
delta = data['Close'].diff()
gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
rs = gain / loss
data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
```

**RSI Analysis:**
- **Range**: 0-100 scale measuring price momentum
- **Overbought**: RSI > 70 suggests potential price decline
- **Oversold**: RSI < 30 indicates potential price increase
- **Momentum**: Rate of change in price movements

**Price Change Percentage:**
```python
data['Price_Change'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
```

**Volatility Measurement:**
- **Daily Returns**: Percentage change from previous day
- **Volatility Indicator**: Higher values indicate increased market uncertainty
- **Risk Assessment**: Helps model understand price movement patterns

### 3.2 Feature Engineering Rationale

   - Smooth out price noise
   - Identify trend direction
   - Generate trading signals

2. **RSI**: 
   - Momentum oscillator
   - Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
   - Helps predict reversal points

3. **Price Change**: 
   - Direct volatility measure
   - Captures market sentiment
   - Essential for risk modeling

**Feature Matrix Structure:**
- **Input Features**: 9 dimensions per time step
- **Sequence Length**: 60 days (approximately 3 months of trading data)
- **Total Parameters**: 540 input parameters per prediction

## 4. Deep Learning Model Architecture

### 4.1 LSTM Network Design

**Why LSTM Over Other Models?**

| Model Type | Advantages | Disadvantages | Suitability for Stock Prediction |
|------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Simple, interpretable | Cannot capture non-linear patterns | Poor - markets are non-linear |
| **Random Forest** | Handles non-linearity | No temporal sequence understanding | Moderate - misses time dependencies |
| **LSTM** | Temporal memory, non-linear | Complex, requires more data | Excellent - captures time series patterns |

**LSTM Architecture Breakdown:**

```python
class SimpleStockPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size=50, num_layers=1):
        super(SimpleStockPredictor, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
```

**Layer-by-Layer Analysis:**

1. **Input Layer**: 9 features × 60 time steps = 540 input parameters
2. **LSTM Layer**: 50 hidden units with memory cells
3. **Fully Connected Layer**: 50 → 1 output (predicted price)

**LSTM Memory Mechanism:**
- **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from cell state
- **Input Gate**: Determines which values to update in cell state
- **Output Gate**: Controls what parts of cell state to output

### 4.2 Training Configuration

**Hyperparameters Selection:**

| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Sequence Length** | 60 days | Captures quarterly business cycles |
| **Hidden Size** | 50 units | Balances complexity vs. overfitting |
| **Batch Size** | 32 samples | Optimal for GPU memory and convergence |
| **Learning Rate** | 0.001 | Conservative rate for stable training |
| **Epochs** | 50 | Sufficient for convergence without overfitting |

**Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Why MSE**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily
- **Gradient Behavior**: Smooth gradients for stable training
- **Interpretability**: Direct relationship to prediction accuracy

**Optimizer**: Adam
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts learning rate per parameter
- **Momentum**: Helps escape local minima
- **Robust**: Works well with sparse gradients

## 5. Data Preprocessing and Normalization

### 5.1 MinMax Scaling Strategy

**Normalization Importance:**
```python
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

**Why MinMax Scaling?**
- **Range Consistency**: All features scaled to [0,1] range
- **Neural Network Optimization**: Prevents gradient vanishing/exploding
- **Feature Equality**: No single feature dominates due to scale differences

**Original vs. Scaled Ranges:**
- **Price**: ₹2,000-3,000 → [0,1]
- **Volume**: 10M-50M → [0,1]
- **RSI**: 0-100 → [0,1]

### 5.2 Sequence Generation

**Time Series Windows:**
```python
class StockDataset(Dataset):
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        x = self.data[idx:idx + self.sequence_length]  # 60 days input
        y = self.data[idx + self.sequence_length, 0]   # Next day target
```

**Sliding Window Approach:**
- **Input**: 60 consecutive days of 9 features
- **Output**: Next day's closing price
- **Overlap**: Each sequence overlaps by 59 days with the next
- **Training Samples**: ~800-900 sequences from 5 years of data

---

## 6. Model Training and Validation

### 6.1 Train-Test Split Strategy

**Data Division:**
- **Training Set**: 80% of historical data (~960 trading days)
- **Testing Set**: 20% of recent data (~240 trading days)
- **Temporal Split**: Chronological division to prevent data leakage

**Why This Split?**
- **Realistic Testing**: Tests on most recent market conditions
- **Sufficient Training**: Enough historical data for pattern learning
- **Time Series Integrity**: Maintains temporal order

### 6.2 Training Process

**Epoch-by-Epoch Learning:**
1. **Forward Pass**: Input sequences through LSTM
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions with actual prices
3. **Backpropagation**: Update weights based on errors
4. **Validation**: Test on unseen data to monitor overfitting

**Training Monitoring:**
- **Loss Curves**: Track training and validation loss convergence
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting when validation loss increases
- **GPU Utilization**: Leverage CUDA for faster training

## 7. Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics

### 7.1 Quantitative Metrics

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**
```python
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actuals, predictions))
```

**RMSE Interpretation:**
- **Units**: Same as target variable (₹)
- **Sensitivity**: Higher penalty for larger errors
- **Benchmark**: Compare against naive forecasting methods

**Performance Visualization:**
- **Time Series Plot**: Actual vs. predicted prices over time
- **Scatter Plot**: Perfect prediction would form diagonal line
- **Residual Analysis**: Error distribution patterns

### 7.2 Model Validation Techniques

**Backtesting Approach:**
1. **Historical Validation**: Test on 20% held-out recent data
2. **Rolling Window**: Validate across different market periods
3. **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Ensure model generalizes to unseen data

## 8. Future Price Prediction Methodology

### 8.1 Recursive Forecasting

**Multi-Step Prediction Process:**
```python
def predict_future(model, last_sequence, scaler, num_days=30):
    for day in range(num_days):
        prediction = model(current_sequence)
        # Update sequence with prediction
        new_sequence = append_prediction_to_sequence(prediction)
```

**Recursive Strategy:**
1. **Initial Input**: Last 60 days of actual data
2. **First Prediction**: Predict day 61
3. **Sequence Update**: Replace oldest day with prediction
4. **Iterate**: Continue for 30 days

**Uncertainty Accumulation:**
- **Error Propagation**: Each prediction builds on previous predictions
- **Confidence Decay**: Accuracy decreases with longer forecasting horizons
- **Risk Assessment**: Consider prediction intervals

### 8.2 Prediction Output Analysis

**Key Metrics Generated:**

30-day predicted return: +1.88%
```

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
- **Short-term Accuracy**: 1-day predictions typically most reliable
